# Introduction

This is a [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) blueprint based on the research done by [@mraible](https://github.com/mraible) and [@joshlong](https://github.com/joshlong) in their [spring-native-examples repository](https://github.com/mraible/spring-native-examples).

For simplicity, it provides an embedded generator-jhipster and a CLI. To learn more, see the following blog posts:

# Installation

To install or update this blueprint:

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster-native
```

To build a Native image, you need to install a JDK that is compatible with GraalVM. Please refer to the [GraalVM Release Notes](https://www.graalvm.org/release-notes/) and install the appropriate JDK. Using SDKMAN simplifies the installation process.

```
sdk install java 22.3.3.r17-grl
```

# Usage

## How to Generate Code

To use this blueprint, run the below command

```bash
jhipster-native
```

When building a new application, we recommend enabling e2e testing with Cypress to ensure that no runtime errors occur.

‚ùØ‚óâ Cypress
```

For available options, you can run

```bash
jhipster-native app --help
```

## How to Build a Native Image

To build a native image, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run native-package
```

After that, set up peripheral services like PostgreSQL using `npm run services:up` and ensure everything is ready.

Lastly, run the Native image and experience its fast startup üòä.

```bash
npm run native-start
```

If you've enabled e2e testing with Cypress, you can verify its operation using the following command:

```bash
npm run native-e2e
```

# Pre-release

To use an unreleased version, install it using npm + git repository.

```bash
npm install -g jhipster/generator-jhipster-native
jhipster-native --skip-jhipster-dependencies
```

# Updated (or pre-release) generator-jhipster

This blueprint embeds a compatible generator-jhipster version, but it's possible to use an updated generator-jhipster by running the `jhipster` cli with `blueprints` option instead of the builtin `jhipster-native`, like:

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster@latest
jhipster --blueprints native
```
