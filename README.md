# Introduction

This is a [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) blueprint based on the work done by @mraible and @joshlong at https://github.com/mraible/spring-native-examples.
For simplicity, it provides an embedded generator-jhipster and a CLI.

# Installation

To install or update this blueprint:

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster-native
```

# Usage

To use this blueprint, run the below command

```bash
jhipster-native
```

For available options, you can run

```bash
jhipster-native app --help
```

# Pre-release

To use an unreleased version, install it using npm + git repository.

```bash
npm install -g jhipster/generator-jhipster-native
jhipster-native --skip-jhipster-dependencies
```

# Updated (or pre-release) generator-jhipster

This blueprint embeds a compatible generator-jhipster version, but it's possible to use an updated generator-jhipster by running the `jhipster` cli with `blueprints` option instead of the builtin `jhipster-native`, like:

```bash
npm install -g jhipster@latest
jhipster --blueprints native
```
